            As I continue to grow my coding skillset, I often reflect on my undergrauate study of English. Like other languages, the languages we use to
            communicate with machines also have syntax, grammar, lexicon, and style. As electronic devices occupy an ever-broader role in our lives,
            communication between humans grows ever more reliant on our communication with our machines.

            The full-time WDI program at GA was my intro to building full stack web applications. There, I gained experience with several popular languages, and
            I developed a good broad-level overview of programming. My time in WDI prepared me well to build on that knowledge as I go on to study other
            frameworks. GA has been a great way to enhance my technical abilities while continuing to develop a network of skilled collaborators.
